## JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging” 
**HANDLING EXCEPTIONS**
- The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors. 
- The catch statement lets you handle the error.
- The throw statement lets you create custom errors.
- The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.

**Debugging**
- Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.
- The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls the debugging function.
- In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. 
- At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.
- After examining values, you can resume the execution of code.
