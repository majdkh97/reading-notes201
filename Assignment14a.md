## Transforms
- The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element.
- This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.
- The transform-origin property allows you to change the position of transformed elements.
- 2D transformations can change the x- and y-axis of an element. 
- 3D transformations can also change the z-axis of an element.

## Transitions 
- CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration. 

**To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:**
- the CSS property you want to add an effect to
- the duration of the effect

## Animations
**CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!**
- An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
- You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.
