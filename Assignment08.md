## Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)
**Controlling the position of elements**
- Normal Flow : the paragraphs appear one by one vertically 
- Relative Positioning : When you set the position relative to an element, without adding any other positioning attributes (top, bottom, right, left) nothing will happen. When you    add an additional position, such as left: 20px the element will move 20px to the right from its normal position.
- Absolute Positioning : places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it.
