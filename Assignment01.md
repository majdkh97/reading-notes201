## HTML CHAPTER 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)
**HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages**
- Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag
- Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
- Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

## HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” (p.176-199)
- Comment is a piece of code which is ignored by any web browser. It is a good practice to add comments into your HTML code, especially in complex documents, to indicate sections of a document, and any other notes to anyone looking at the code. Comments help you and others understand your code and increases code readability.
- HTML comments are placed in between <!-- ... --> tags. So, any content placed with-in <!-- ... --> tags will be treated as comment and will be completely ignored by the browser.
- The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.
- You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.
- The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.
- Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

## HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” (pp.428-451)
- The < header > element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
- The < hooter > tag defines a footer for a document or section.
- The < nav > tag defines a set of navigation links.
- The < article > tag specifies independent, self-contained content.
- The < div > tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

## HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” (pp.452-475) 
-  A wireframe is a schematic or blueprint that is useful for helping you, your programmers and designers think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you're building.
- Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.
