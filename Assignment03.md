## Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)
**HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.**
- Unordered HTML List: An unordered list starts with the < ul > tag. Each list item starts with the < li > tag.The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default.
- Ordered HTML List: An ordered list starts with the < ol > tag. Each list item starts with the < li > tag. The list items will be marked with numbers by default.
- HTML Description Lists: A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term. The < dl > tag defines the description list, the < dt > tag defines the term (name), and the < dd > tag describes each term.

## Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)
**In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.**

**Explanation of the different parts:**
- Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
- Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
- Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
- Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)

**The JavaScript Switch Statement: Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.**

**How it works**
- The switch expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
- If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

**The break Keyword: When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block. This will stop the execution inside the switch block. It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.**

**The default Keyword: The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match**
