## What Google Learned About Teams

**Studies have found that teams are more productive than individuals working by themselves and that good teamwork can lead to product innovation, better results, and higher job satisfaction**

**So the researchers measured team effectiveness in four different ways:**

- Executive evaluation of the team
- Team leader evaluation of the team
- Team member evaluation of the team
- Sales performance against quarterly quota

**sample items used in the study that participants were asked to agree or disagree with:**
- Group dynamics: I feel safe expressing divergent opinions to the team.
- Skill sets: I am good at navigating roadblocks and barriers.
- Personality traits: I see myself as someone who is a reliable worker.
- Emotional intelligence: I am not interested in other people’s problems.

**The researchers found that what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together.**
- Psychological safety: Psychological safety refers to an individual’s perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk 
- Dependability: On dependable teams, members reliably complete quality work on time
- Structure and clarity: An individual’s understanding of job expectations, the process for fulfilling these expectations
- Meaning: Finding a sense of purpose in either the work itself or the output is important for team effectiveness
- Impact: The results of one’s work
